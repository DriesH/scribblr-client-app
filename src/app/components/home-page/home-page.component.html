<!--<h1 class="title"><i class="fa fa-quote-left blue"></i> Quotes and stories</h1>
<p>Kids have amazing amounts of creativity. A lot more than adults. That's why children often say funny or ingenious things
    during their childhood.</p>
<br>
<p>Kids are also real explorers. As they grow up, they constantly learn and experience new things.</p>
<p>That one amazing day at the seaside, their first day of school or the day they make the most beautiful drawing.</p>
<br>
<p>All these memories are worth saving! With Scribblr this is only a matter of seconds.</p>-->
